# Word Embeddings and Topic Modeling (CPSC 330)

This project was completed as part of UBC's Applied Machine Learning (CPSC 330) course. The goal was to explore foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using word embeddings and unsupervised learning for topic discovery.

## Project Objectives

- Applied word embedding techniques to capture semantic relationships in textual data:
  - Word2Vec
  - GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)
- Implemented topic modeling to uncover hidden themes within documents.
- Visualized and interpreted word relationships and topic distributions.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** Gensim, scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Techniques:** Natural Language Processing, Word Embeddings, Topic Modeling, Unsupervised Learning

## Skills Developed

- Practical experience processing textual data for machine learning applications.
- Improved ability to analyze word relationships using embedding models.
- Gained understanding of topic modeling for unsupervised text analysis.
