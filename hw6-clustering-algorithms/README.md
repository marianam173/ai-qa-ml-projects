# Clustering with K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN (CPSC 330)

This project was completed as part of UBC's Applied Machine Learning (CPSC 330) course. The focus was on applying unsupervised learning techniques for clustering datasets, comparing algorithms, and interpreting results.

## Project Objectives

- Implemented multiple clustering algorithms including:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical (Agglomerative) Clustering
  - DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)
- Evaluated clustering results using visualizations and relevant performance metrics.
- Compared the strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate use cases for each method.
- Interpreted cluster assignments and explored parameter tuning.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Techniques:** Unsupervised learning, clustering, hyperparameter tuning, data visualization

## Skills Developed

- Practical experience applying clustering methods for dataset segmentation.
- Strengthened ability to select appropriate models based on data characteristics.
- Improved data interpretation and presentation using visual techniques.
